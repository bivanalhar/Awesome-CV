\textbf{Software Engineer with 5 years of experience, including 2 years as a Full Stack Software Engineer and 3 years as a Machine Learning Engineer.} As a Full Stack Software Engineer, I contributed to Coursemology, an ed‑tech platform serving hundreds of thousands of users, by developing scalable features that boosted student engagement through gamification, automated grading, and interactive feedback. Additionally, I streamlined teaching workflows by writing efficient, scalable code, optimizing performance, deploying cloud‑based solutions with CI/CD pipelines, and collaborating with cross‑functional teams to deliver impactful products.

Furthermore, as a Machine Learning Engineer, I applied ML/DL models to solve business challenges, specializing in data wrangling, pipeline development, and large‑scale data processing to extract insights and support data‑driven decisions.
